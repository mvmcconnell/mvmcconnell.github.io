## What's included

Poole is a streamlined Jekyll site designed and built as a foundation for building more meaningful themes. Poole, and every theme built on it like this one, includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ '404.html' | relative_url }}), [RSS feed]({{ 'atom.xml' | relative_url }}), posts, [archive page]({{ 'archive' | relative_url }}), and [example page]({{ 'about' | relative_url }}))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Jekyll's built-in support for Rouge

Additional features are available in individual themes.

## Browser support

Poole and its themes are by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), Firefox, and Edge.
